# Applied Machine Learning  Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio. As a Mathematician specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Logic, this repository showcases my ability to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical theory and practical algorithmic implementation. 

Rather than just importing libraries, these notebooks focus on understanding the underlying mechanics, optimization processes, and trade-offs of different machine learning architectures.

##  Repository Contents

This repository is structured around three core paradigms of Machine Learning:

### 1. [01_tree_based_models.ipynb](./01_tree_based_models.ipynb)
* **Topic:** Decision Trees.
* **Focus:** Implementation and tuning of tree-based algorithms. Includes hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

### 2. [02_deep_learning_neural_networks.ipynb](./02_deep_learning_neural_networks.ipynb)
* **Topic:** Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
* **Focus:** Design and training of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Covers architectural decisions, activation functions, loss optimization, and the mathematical intuition behind backpropagation to solve complex non-linear classification/regression tasks.

### 3. [03_semi_supervised_learning_techniques.ipynb](./03_semi_supervised_learning_techniques.ipynb)
* **Topic:** Semi-Supervised Learning.
* **Focus:** Addressing real-world data scarcity. Demonstrates techniques to leverage small amounts of labeled data alongside large pools of unlabeled data (e.g., Label Propagation, Pseudo-labeling), maximizing predictive performance when manual labeling is not feasible.

##  Tech Stack & Tools
* **Languages:** Python
* **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `NumPy`
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn`
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

##  Why this approach?
Coming from a pure Mathematics background (including research in Post-Quantum Cryptography), I approach Data Science with a focus on **algorithmic rigor**. I aim to build models that are not only accurate but also mathematically sound, optimized, and tailored to the specific constraints of the data available.

**Note**: While this repository and documentation are in English, the inline markdown explanations within the older notebooks are written in Spanish. However, the Python logic, data pipelines, and mathematical models are universally readable.
